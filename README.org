* Overview

Trying this again, but putting everything I've learned into practice. Last go around I realized I finally got all of my grand abstractions working and I'd just ended making a bespoke A-Frame. So let's try building this again, but with A-Frame as our framework we're targeting with our Clojurescript, instead of Three.js.

* Creation

In the beginning was:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  lein new figwheel endless-summer-aframe -- --reagent
#+END_SRC
